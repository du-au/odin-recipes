        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Coffee was introduced into Vietnam in 1857 by a French Catholic priest in the form of a single <i>Coffea arabica</i>
        tree. The beverage was adopted with regional variations. Because of limitations on the availability of fresh milk, as
        the dairy farming industry was still in it infancy, the French and Vietnamese began to use sweetened condensed milk with
        a dark roast coffee.</p>

        <p>Vietnam did not become a major exporter of coffee until the Doi Moi reforms and opening of the economy after the war.
        Now, many coffee farms exist across the central highlands. Vietnam is now the largest producer of the Robusta variety of
        coffee and the second largest producer of coffee worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons Vietnamese ground coffee</li>
            <li>1-3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk (depending on your preference)</li>
            <li>6-8 ounces water that is close to boiling point (depending on your desired coffee strength)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Measure 3 tablespoons of ground coffee, and distribute it evenly into the filter.</li>
            <li>Do NOT shake the filters or compress the coffee, or the coffee grounds will drop into the holes of the coffee
            filter and plug up the holes. The result will be that the coffee takes forever to drip, or the grounds may clog the
            filter entirely. Place the metal filter gently on top of the coffee.</li>
            <li>Pour your desired amount of condensed milk into a mug or heatproof glass.</li>
            <li>Measure out 6 ounces of near boiling water. Use 8 ounces if you don't like your coffee with such a strong kick in
            the pants.</li>
            <li>With the filter placed over the glass, pour two tablespoons of hot water into the filter and wait for 5 seconds
            to "bloom" the coffee. The bloom is the part of the coffee brewing process when the water releases CO2 from the
            coffee, and the grounds expand.</li>
            <li>Next, press on the filter gently to compress the bloomed coffee. This helps slow down the drip rate when you use
            all of your water, and also makes for a more flavorful coffee.</li>
            <li>With these steps, you'll be able to achieve the optimum brewing time. That said, now slowly pour the rest of the
            water into the filter, and the coffee will begin dripping into your cup or glass.</li>
            <li>Wait about 5 minutes for the coffee to finish drip brewing.</li>
            <li>Remove the filter, and stir to mix in the condensed milk.</li>
        </ol>
