        <h2>Description</h2>

        Cha gio, also known as fried spring roll, is a popular dish in Vietnamese cuisine and usually served as an appetizer in
        Europe and North America, where there are large Vietnamese diaspora. It is ground meat, usually pork, wrapped in rice
        paper and deep-fried.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>50 g dried mung bean noodles (1 package)</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons sugar (12g - divided)</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water - for soaking rice wrappers (250 ml)</li>
            <li>20 dried rice paper wrappers (bánh tráng)</li>
            <li>canola or vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        </ul>

        To Serve:
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh green leaf lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, and mint</li>
            <li>Nuoc cham dipping sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the filling:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak the dried mung bean noodles in warm water (submerge them completely) for 30 minutes. Drain
                    thoroughly, and cut into ¼ inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the noodles, ground pork, grated carrot, chopped wood ear mushrooms, shallots,
                    garlic, ginger egg white, fish sauce, vegetable oil, salt, white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix until
                    everything is uniformly combined.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Wrap and chill the spring rolls:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large, shallow bowl or deep plate, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 cup warm water.
                    Sugar is optional but does help the spring rolls to brown when frying.</li>
                    <li>To wrap each roll, place a rice paper wrapper into the sugar water for about 5-10 seconds, making sure
                    it is completely submerged. Remove it from the water. It will still be quite firm, but it will soften
                    quickly!</li>
                    <li>Place about 40g of filling in a log shape on one side of the wrapper. Begin tightly folding the wrapper
                    over the filling (no air bubbles!), and roll the spring roll forward 1 complete revolution. Lightly press
                    down on each end of the filling to flatten the rice paper and push the filling together to eliminate any air
                    bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Fold one side of the wrapper towards the middle of the spring roll. Repeat with the other side. Roll the
                    spring roll forward while tucking in the front to prevent air pockets. The rice paper wrapper will stick to
                    itself. It doesn't require anything additional to seal. Place the rolls on a plate or sheet pan lined with a
                    clean, dry kitchen towel or parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Once wrapped, transfer the spring rolls to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour, so they can
                    dry out and firm up. This step helps minimize the wrapper bubbling when frying (though bubbling is normal).
                    Take them out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before frying.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Double-fry the spring rolls:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat about 3 cups of canola or vegetable oil in a medium pot to 335°F/170°C (the oil level should be a
                    little over halfway up the sides). Fry the spring rolls in small batches—about three at a time. Make sure
                    they do not touch just after they are placed in the oil as the skins will be sticky until a crust forms. Cook
                    each batch for 5 to 6 minutes, or until light golden brown. (Frying them in small batches prevents them from
                    sticking to each other.)</li>
                    <li>Use a metal slotted spoon to pull them out of the oil. Drain on a rack, and continue frying. Maintain the
                    correct oil temperature by periodically adjusting your heat.</li>
                    <li>When ready to serve, refry the spring rolls (yes, they need to be fried twice) at 350°F/175°C for 1 ½ to
                    2 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Double-frying is important! Serve with fresh lettuce, cilantro, Thai
                    basil, mint and nuoc cham for dipping.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
